abstract = {We present absolute intensities for rotational Raman scattering (RRS) from N2, O2, and CO2, excited at 488.0 and 647.1 nm. The absolute scattering intensity for N2 at 488.0 nm is characterized by its differential cross section for backscattering, summed over Stokes and anti-Stokes bands and over scattered-light polarizations, which we find to be 1.64 {\texttimes} 10{\textminus}29 cm2/sr {\textpm}8\%. The ratio of the cross section for O2 to that for N2 at 488.0 nm is 2.61 {\textpm} 5\%, whereas the corresponding ratio for CO2 to N2 is 10.6 {\textpm} 10\%. Our values for RRS cross sections relative to the N2 vibrational Raman cross section are in reasonable agreement with corresponding ratios reported recently by Fenner et al. On the other hand, our absolute cross sections are approximately twice as large as those obtained from the results of Fenner et al., but agree closely with values calculated from recent measurements of the depolarization of Rayleigh scattering. Detailed observations of relative rotational-Raman-line intensities at temperatures of 22, 75, and 125 {\textdegree}C are consistent with theoretical predictions.},

abstract={In this paper, an adaptive temperature demodulation method to eliminate Rayleigh noise real-timely in Raman distributed temperature sensors using anti-Stokes light only has been presented. The theoretical model calculating Rayleigh noise is proposed. Based on known parameters, the Rayleigh noise can be calculated and then eliminated simultaneously by the intensity of the signal composed by anti-Stokes light and Rayleigh noise at two different temperatures. In our experiments, two sections of reference fiber I, II are utilized and their temperatures were set at 27 and 40 {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}circ {\}}{\backslash}hbox {\{}C{\}}{\$}{\$}respectively. Experiment results indicate that the temperature errors caused by Rayleigh noise are decreased by 4 and 6 {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}circ {\}}{\backslash}hbox {\{}C{\}}{\$}{\$}at 50 and 70 {\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}circ {\}}{\backslash}hbox {\{}C{\}}{\$}{\$}respectively after using this method.},

abstract = {Traditional preparation methods for cytology samples pose a significant problem for Raman micro-spectroscopy, with long-established clinical techniques depositing cells on glass slides. Unfortunately, both the signal from the glass slide and the baseline signal from the cell itself obscure the Raman cell spectrum. The intensity of the glass signal varies from cell to cell depending on morphology, and although smooth, the signal is more complex within the fingerprint region than the baseline, and cannot be easily removed from the Raman spectrum using polynomial fitting techniques. It is difficult to accurately remove both background signals, and therefore, the use of standard glass slides compromises the capability of pre-processing methods to extract reliable and reproducible spectra from biological cells. To avoid this signal, Raman spectra are often recorded from cells on expensive substrates, such as calcium fluoride (CaF2) or quartz, but this practice is impractical for large scale applications of Raman cytology for diagnostics or screening purposes. This study investigates the potential of a number of background subtraction algorithms to remove both the glass signal and the baseline, and investigates the effect of these algorithms on subsequent multivariate analysis for the purpose of cell classification. This study demonstrates that the well-known extended multivariate signal correction (EMSC) algorithm is particularly effective in this regard, and that the results of subsequent multivariate statistical analysis are independent of the reference cell spectrum used in the algorithm. Matlab code is provided for the implementation of the EMSC algorithm.}

  abstract = "The Raman shift is one of the most important parameters in Raman
              spectroscopy, and is calculated from the difference in the
              wavenumbers for excitation and for Raman scattering. Because the
              observed shifts are strongly dependent on the spectrometer and
              the measurement conditions, physically and chemically stable
              reference materials for Raman-shift validation are required. We
              reliably estimated the Raman shift and evaluated its uncertainty
              for peaks of a 4-mm-thick, 25-mm-diameter polystyrene disc by
              using a HeNe laser and Raman-scattered light calibrated with
              Ne/Ar emission lines. We considered uncertainties originating
              from the fitting, repeatability, and reproducibility of both the
              Ne/Ar emission lines and the Rayleigh/Raman-scattered lights, as
              well as the wavenumber of the unstabilised HeNe laser, and pixel
              and spectral resolutions. We also considered uncertainty
              originating from inhomogeneity among and within discs, as well as
              their long-term stability. The obtained Raman shifts of 11 peaks
              (reference values) were comparable to those described in ASTM
              E1840 with expanded uncertainty at 1.1 or 1.2 cm(-1) (k = 2,
